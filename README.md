# Program-Control-Panel
This is a collection of various Java programs that range from robot arm and laser harp controllers to video games and simulators. Every program can be launched from the program control panel as long as the desired program is specified in the Programs.txt file of Resources.
#### API
The program control panel is located within the `com.butler.main` package, and the main class is `ProgramHub`. The first thing that the control panel does is search through the Programs.txt file in the Resources directory for valid programs.
